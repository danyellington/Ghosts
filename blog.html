    <h3>MY RANT</h3>
    <h4>11/14/17</h4>
    <p>Ghosts exist. I am <span class="crazy">serious</span>, man. I saw one in the bathroom yesterday. He said,
    "Bobby, I am a ghost." Then I said, "Get away Mr. Ghost! You are scarring me." Then he left.
    In retrospect, I may have hurt his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>As far as I can tell, most ghosts are just dead folks. I haven't encountered any demonic spirits,
      but I dare them! Come at me!
    </p>
    <h3>GHOSTBUSTERS</h3>
    <h4>10/18/17</h4>
    <p>The Ghostbusters are real too! I totally saw Bill Murray sucking up some ghosts last
      week in my backyard. I told my therapist about it and she recommended upping my dose of
      Haldol.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, Ghostbusters was a documentary ahead of it's time. I'm still surprised to
      see these guys working in the field. Isn't Bill Murray like 70 now? Talk about committed to your craft.

      <h3>GHOST DESSERTS</h3>
      <h4>6/15/17</h4>
      <p>Ghosts LOVE desserts! They can't get fat from food because they're dead, so they can eat
        dessert every meal of the day if they want. Like in Casper. They taste it, but it falls right through.
        This can be very messy, so tell the ghost to take the treats outside.
